# Cryptocurrencies
## This project uses unsupervised learning to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded. Machine learning models were implemented to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped to classify a new investment product.The data provided is insufficient, and has been processed to fit the machine learning models. As there is no known output for what we are looking for, unsupervised learning was used. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was used to help determine investing in the product.
